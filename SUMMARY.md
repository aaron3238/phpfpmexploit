# A short summary of my CSC385 semester experience. 

This has been one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Kutztown. I was able to pursue something I wanted to learn about in my free time at my own pace. On top of that, the topics we touched on throughout the semester were invaluable pieces of knowledge that every CS major should be leaving with. 

I actually learned a great deal while working on the hackthebox lessons and I barely scratched the surface of what is available there. It was rewarding being able to use that knowledge, find an relatively recent exploit, and create a lesson exploiting it using the tools I made use of during my lessons. Also, I wasn't quite sure what I would put on top of the nginx server as an additonal layer of exploitation, so I just decided to install a build of my senior project while it is still wildly insecure. It's sort of similar to the lessons on hackthebox but obviously no where near as complex. 

Overall, the class and project were certainly worthwhile, and I will be recommending the class to fellow classmates.
