#   PHP-FPM Exploit Example 
##  Description:
- This repository contains a powerpoint illustrating two different    methods for exploiting the PHP-FPM Vulnerability (CVE-2019-11043) along with the files to do so.


## Installation Instructions (also written in powerpoint):

1. Install docker https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop for your operating system.
2. Clone this repository. 
3. Navigate to the "reproducer" folder
4. Run the following commands 
   - `docker build -t reproduce-cve-2019-11043 .`
   - `docker run --rm -ti -p 8080:80 reproduce-cve-2019-11043`

### With the above complete, you should have a container running an nginx server. You can check to see if it is running with.
  - `docker ps`


## Do the exploit
### Follow the instructions and images in the provided powerpoint to exploit the vulnerability. 


## Bonus round 

#### I added a build of my senior seminar project to the container. Once you've completed the above exploit, you will notice in the file system that there are additional files being served. A build of my senior seminar project, Meeting Manager, is installed and running on the nginx server. Meeting Manager as it is currently configured is wildly insecure (intentionally). With a little bit of time in the web browser, you should be able to access the database and obtain user information with little to no effort. I am not going to include instructions for doing so, as I want to leave something up in the air with this and for you to have a little fun (if you can call messing around with my project fun).
